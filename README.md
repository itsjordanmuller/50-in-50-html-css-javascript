<summary align="center"><h2>📖 About The Project</h2></summary>
<h3>📂 Project Introduction</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/"><strong>50 Projects In 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript</strong></a> is a course I took that is designed to teach front-end development through practical projects. Led by instructors <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/brad-traversy/">Brad Traversy</a> and <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/popflorin/">Florin Pop</a>, it offers a hands-on approach to learning, where I built 50 different mini-projects. These projects cover a wide range of skills and design principles, from simple UI elements to fully interactive web games, and are aimed at strengthening my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>⛳ Learning Objectives & Goals</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
My main goal in undertaking this course was to develop a comprehensive skill set in front-end web development. I focused on learning not just the syntax of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but also their application in building interactive and responsive web interfaces. The projects were structured to progressively challenge my skills and deepen my understanding of essential web development concepts.
</p>
<p>
In this project, I worked with <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and vanilla <strong>JavaScript</strong>. The course also introduced me tools like <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, <strong>Axios</strong>, <strong>ESLint</strong>, and <strong>Prettier</strong>. I used a variety of external resources, including <strong>Font Awesome</strong> icons & <strong>Unsplash</strong> images. Spending time on these technologies was crucial in building a foundational understanding of web development, emphasizing the importance of mastering basic concepts before progressing to more advanced frameworks.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>🗓️ Project Timeline</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I began the first project on <strong>August 13th, 2023</strong> and committed to completing one project daily, concluding in 50 days. The project sizes were manageable, with each taking about one to three hours. This structured approach provided a consistent learning pace, where each new day presented a fresh challenge and an opportunity to apply the knowledge I had gained.</p>

<h4>Looking for Live Demos? 🌐</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you're eager to simply see the results of this project, most, if not all of the projects have a Live Demo associated with them. I have linked them all in the overview for each specific project/section. To view these live demos, simply follow the links provided with each project. You'll see them alongside buttons that look like this:</p>

  <table >
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>
          <a href="https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/50-in-50-html-css-javascript/tree/main">Live Demo</a>

        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>Click the button/link and you should be taken to the Live Demo for that specific project. Please note that some projects don't have a Live Demo, and if that's the case there will not be a button/link. I'm hoping to get all of the projects on the internet at some point in the near future, so check back soon and you might find a link!</p>

<h4>Want to View the Projects on Your Local Machine? 💻</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have provided detailed instructions for how to clone/download this repository to your local machine in the Setup Instructions section. In that section, you should find everything you need to be able to get these projects running and working on your own machine. Please note that a few of the projects use external APIs that include verification, so you will need to setup your own accounts/API keys for those services.</p>
  <p>If you plan on running the code on your local machine, be sure to check the specific project you're trying to run to see if it needs any additional information or setup for the connections to the API to work. In most cases, I will try to include a `.env.example` file. You will need to open this file, and read the instructions inside to obtain your own API key. Once that's done, you'll need to make sure you've renamed the file from `.env.example` to `.env` only.</p>
  <p>If you want to avoid setting up environment variables, check to see if the project has a Live Demo associated with it. For all of the projects that I have hosted on the internet, you'll be able to use them without any API configuration required. This is often a simpler way of viewing more complicated projects, since everything will already be running for you to view, use & explore.</p>

  <p>I have provided a variety of resources and guides throughout this README for new developers. From the absolute basics, to specific videos and guides that helped me get unstuck in certain situations, I tried to include every single resource I ended up utilizing over the course of my journey.</p>
  <p>We are so lucky to live in a time where almost all of this information is available for free on the internet. The only thing I paid for was the course itself, which can be purchased for about $20 on sale at <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a>. Besides that, I was able to complete the project with a low-spec <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0842X4BNF">Lenovo Thinkpad T480</a> I purchased for just under $300. It's proven to be a perfect machine for development & running <a href="https://kubuntu.org/">Kubuntu Linux</a>.</p>

To be able to clone/download & view these projects, or to start learning <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> as well as web development in general, you'll need a few essential tools. At a minimum, you should have a basic text editor/integrated development environment, a web browser, and an internet connection.

I used the following:

- **Text Editor/IDE:** I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my main integrated development environment. VS Code can be customized to work with just about any technology, making it a great choice for a general all-purpose IDE, it also has a large and helpful community for support.
- **Web Browser:** I prefer to use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) for their comprehensive set of [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/). While most if not all of the tools are available in other browsers/Developer Tools such as [Firefox DevTools](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/index.html), [Safari Web Inspector](https://webkit.org/web-inspector/), and [Edge DevTools](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/landing/), I am most familiar & comfortable with the layout of Chrome.
- **Internet Connection:** Aim to have at least 2-3 Mbps or more to speed up development, especially if you'll be downloading large files or loading video/image based resources. Most libraries and a variety of public places can have high-speed Wi-Fi available for visitors free-of-charge.

Based on the fact that you're reading this right now, you probably already have a browser & internet connection!

[Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows), [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/), and most [Linux distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution) should include a text editor by default, which in this case should be more than enough to view and edit HTML, CSS & JavaScript files.

For those using mobile devices, I advise switching to a laptop or desktop for a more streamlined experience. While mobile development is feasible on Android or iOS, the ease of a full-sized computer, keyboard, and mouse is unmatched. Visual Studio Code is accessible via most browsers on any device, however, you would still need to serve/host it from another machine. For optimal functionality, a personal computer remains the best choice.

<summary><h4>System Requirements 🖥️</h4></summary>

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>

System requirements for these projects can vary due to the fact that they use different amounts of client-side processing power and resources. In general, a recent operating system like [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows), [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/), or a popular [Linux distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution) usually suffices. Modern computers, especially those purchased in the last few years, should meet these needs adequately.

Performance will heavily rely on your specific hardware setup, including processor speed, RAM capacity, storage type, and graphics card quality. The operating system choice and its configuration also play a significant role in speed.

To give you a practical example, I personally used a [Lenovo Thinkpad T480](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0842X4BNF) for the entirety of my recent projects. This laptop, has been great for a variety of daily tasks, including programming.

The computer I used for the entire project features the following specifications:

- **Operating System:** [Kubuntu Linux 22.04](https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/22.04/release/)
- **Processor:** 8th Gen Intel Core Duo i5-8350U
- **RAM:** 16GB DDR4 RAM
- **Storage:** 512GB SSD of data
- **Graphics:** Intel UHD Graphics 620
- **Display:** 14.0" Screen with FHD 1920x1080 resolution.

This configuration was more than sufficient for both my project and other tasks. Interestingly, working on a less powerful laptop has its advantages, such as highlighting inefficient code that consumes excessive resources.

If you're unsure, I recommend testing your setup with the intended software. Should you encounter any errors, feel free to reach out for assistance. Your feedback can also help in making projects more adaptable to diverse hardware, operating systems, and browsers.

## Project Details

### HTML Structure
The HTML file for this project defines the structure of the web page. It includes the following key elements:

- The viewport meta tag is used for responsive scaling on different devices.
- An external CSS file is linked for styling.
- The main content is enclosed within a `<div>` element with the class "container."
- Inside the container, there is a heading "Verify Your Account," a paragraph with instructions, a code container, and a small info message.
- The code container consists of six input fields, each representing a digit of the verification code.
- Each input field is of type "number" and has a placeholder for a single digit (0-9). It is also limited to accepting only numeric input within the range of 0 to 9.
- A small info message informs the user that this is a design-only interface and that no email has actually been sent.

### CSS Styling
The CSS file provides styling to the web page, creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. Here are some key styling points:

- The background color of the body is set to a light blue.
- The "container" element is styled to have a white background, a solid black border, rounded corners, padding, and text centered within it.
- The "code-container" is styled to display the code input fields in a centered and evenly spaced layout.
- Each code input field ("code") is styled to have a rounded appearance, a large font size, a specific width and height, and a border.
- The code input fields are set to disable the default spin buttons used for number inputs.
- When a valid code is entered, the input field is styled with a blue border and a box shadow.
- The small info message has a light gray background, padding, and rounded corners.

### JavaScript Functionality
The JavaScript file adds functionality to the web page for a smoother user experience. Here's how it works:

- The JavaScript code selects all code input fields using `document.querySelectorAll(".code")`.
- It focuses on the first input field by default using `codes[0].focus()`.
- Event listeners are added to each code input field to listen for keydown events.
- When a numeric key (0-9) is pressed, the current input field is cleared, and focus is shifted to the next input field (if available) after a brief delay.
- When the "Backspace" key is pressed, focus is shifted to the previous input field (if available) after a brief delay.

This JavaScript functionality mimics the behavior of entering a six-digit verification code, making it a user-friendly experience.

# Random Image Feed

The "Random Image Feed" is a web application that displays a feed of random images obtained from the Unsplash website. This application generates a grid of images with different sizes and presents them in an organized manner.

## HTML Structure

The HTML file defines the structure of the web page. Key elements include:

- The viewport meta tag for responsive scaling on different devices.
- External CSS link for styling.
- The page title is set to "Random Image Feed."
- An `<h1>` element with the class "title" displays the title of the feed.
- A `<div>` with the class "container" serves as the main content container for the random images.
- The JavaScript file is included at the end of the body to load and manipulate the images.

## CSS Styling

The CSS file provides styling to create an organized and visually appealing image feed:

- The "Roboto" font family is used for text elements.
- The body is styled to display content in the center of the viewport.
- The title is centered and slightly spaced from the top.
- The container for images is styled with flex properties to create a grid-like layout.
- Images within the container are styled with specific dimensions (300x300 pixels) and have an object-fit property set to "cover" for proper scaling.

## JavaScript Functionality

The JavaScript file adds functionality to generate random images and display them in the feed:

- The `container` element is selected using its class for image insertion.
- The `unsplashURL` variable holds the base URL for random images from Unsplash.
- The `rows` variable defines the number of rows in the image grid.
- A loop creates and appends random images to the container by setting the `src` attribute with different image sizes generated by the `getRandomSize` function.
- The `getRandomSize` function generates random dimensions for the images.
- The `getRandomNum` function generates random numbers for image dimensions.

## Key Features

- Automatic generation of a grid-like image feed with random images.
- Images are obtained from the Unsplash website.
- Responsive design with organized image layout.
- Customizable image dimensions and number of rows by modifying variables in the JavaScript file.

This "Random Image Feed" serves as a simple example of how to create a dynamic image feed on a web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can easily customize the appearance and behavior of the feed by adjusting variables in the JavaScript file or modifying the CSS styles.

# Todo List

The "Todo List" is a simple web application that allows users to create and manage a list of tasks or to-do items. Users can add new tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them as needed. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## HTML Structure

The HTML file defines the structure of the web page. Key elements include:

- The viewport meta tag for responsive scaling on different devices.
- External CSS link for styling.
- The page title is set to "Todo List."
- An `<h1>` element with the text "todos" serves as the title of the todo list.
- A `<form>` element with an `<input>` field and a `<ul>` element with the class "todos" is used to input and display todo items.
- A `<small>` element provides instructions to the user on how to interact with the todo list.
- The JavaScript file is included at the end of the body to add functionality.

## CSS Styling

The CSS file provides styling to create an organized and user-friendly todo list:

- The "Roboto" font family is used for text elements.
- The body is styled to display content in the center of the viewport with a light background color.
- The title "todos" is styled with a large font size, color, and opacity.
- The input field is styled with borders and padding, and it changes color on focus.
- Placeholder text is styled with a light color.
- The todo list is styled as a white box with individual items separated by borders.
- Completed todo items have a strikethrough text decoration and a gray color.
- The instructions at the bottom are styled with a lighter color and margin.

## JavaScript Functionality

The JavaScript file adds functionality to manage the todo list:

- The `form`, `input`, and `todosUL` elements are selected using their IDs for interaction.
- The application retrieves saved todos from local storage using `localStorage.getItem`.
- The event listener for the form handles todo submission by calling the `addTodo` function.
- The `addTodo` function creates a new todo item and appends it to the todo list.
- Todo items can be marked as completed by clicking on them, and completed items have their completion status updated in local storage.
- Right-clicking on a todo item deletes it, and the updated list is stored in local storage using the `updateLS` function.

## Key Features

- Creation of a todo list with add, complete, and delete functionalities.
- Persistent storage of todo items in local storage to retain data across page refreshes.
- Stylish and user-friendly design with clear instructions.

The "Todo List" application provides a basic but functional example of how to create a todo list using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can easily add, complete, and delete tasks, and their data is stored locally for convenience.

# Insect Catch Game

The "Insect Catch Game" is a simple web-based game where the player's objective is to catch insects that appear on the screen. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and consists of several screens.

## HTML Structure

- Upon selecting an insect, the game begins, and insects start appearing on the screen.

### Screen 3: Game Screen
- The third screen serves as the game interface.
- It displays the player's score, time elapsed, and a message.
- Insects appear randomly on the screen, and the player's task is to click on them to catch them.
- The player's score increases with each caught insect.
- As the player's score exceeds 19, a message is displayed.

## JavaScript Functionality

- The game keeps track of the player's score and time.
- Insects are created and placed randomly on the screen at regular intervals.

<p>You may find that some anchor links in this README do not work well on the Android version of the GitHub mobile app. This is a known issue with GitHub mobile app, and I've yet to find a solution for it. </p>

<ul>
  <li>I had the following options:
    <ul>
      <li>Remove all anchor tags/links that are used to scroll down to a specific section</li>
      <li>Leave the links broken on Android, but usable everywhere else</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
  
<p>I have decided to leave the links as they are. I believe it greatly enhances the experience of viewing my repositories & READMEs & outweighs the potential downsides.</p>
<p>I'm hoping that GitHub will fix this at some point, but until then, I would recommend using GitHub in your mobile browser, installed as a Progressive Web App (PWA), or on a computer.</p>
<p>This README was designed to be responsive on large & small screens, but is best viewed in a large resolution on a desktop.</p>

<p>Brad,</p>
<p>Your way of teaching made the complex concepts of web development accessible and engaging. The clarity and depth of your explanations in each of the 50 projects have greatly improved my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
<p>Your passion for teaching and commitment to helping students like me understand the nuances of web development is truly admirable. I feel much more confident in my abilities to create web projects thanks to your instruction. Thank you for being such a fantastic mentor and teacher.</p>
